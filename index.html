Lost And All Alone

It is the year 3143 and Earth is on the brink of human extinction.
We have the ignored the warnings that mother natured has given us.
Mankind's greed and selfishness have caused our skies to turn black.
The CO2 emissions have reached unpredecented levels.  Already the ice-caps
have melted away and the current life in this world is now a relentless oven.
Electronics have begun failing and cancer rates have sky-rocketed.

This is the story about two scientists who are very focused on their own
methods to try to save the human race.
The male protagonist, Hank, is computer scientist who has also studied quantum physics
believes that the best way to save the population is by sending humans
to other planets - space colonization.  But is the technology for space travel
there?  Will he be able to figure out a way to get humans off this planet in time?

The female protagonist, Cris, is also a computer scientist and equally as brilliant
as Hank.  Cris also has a biology background.  She believes the way to save
the human race is via human evololution.  She is hoping to create a substance that
taken over time will give humans a resistance to extreme temperatures.  In time she
hopes that humans will become immune to the global warming effects.


Chapter1 - The gathering of minds
---------------------------------
There is a meeting for scientists to talk about their ideas on how to save
the human race
mini-game Hank: Hank, being an environmentalist wakes up a bit late after doing
some midnight coding.  He lives 40km from the meeting location.  He must get to
the meeting in 1hour time via his bicycle.  Mini-game, avoid traffic and go bike
quickly to the meeting!
mini-game Cris:  Cris, wakes up with a head-ache.  We find a report on her desk
stating that she has a cancerous tumour in her brain and she has less than 6months to live.
Cris only lives 1 block from this meeting location, but she is having a really,
really, really bad head-ache and is having problems even walking straight.  Mission:
walk her to the meeting.  She cannot stray off the sidewalk (otherwise she'll get
hit by a car)

Chapter2 - They hate each other
-------------------------------
Hank meets Cris at this scientist meeting.  They begin screaming at each other
...
TODO think of a mini-game

Chapter3 - Mutual Respect
-------------------------
Hank and Cris share a lab.  Late one night, Cris gets another attack from her
tumor.  Game: Guide Cris to a chair to sit down before she blanks out
Game: Hank - Hank has a brilliant idea and wants to test it out in the lab,
but due to earth's failing electronics, the corridor lights are out.  Hank has 3 matches.
You must figure out this black maze from Door Entry to Lab Door by using your matches.
Hank eventually finds his way to the lab and as he turns on the light, Cris wakes
up feeling better.  Hank is impressed by Cris's late night dedication to work on her
project.  Cris is equally impressed.

Chapter4 - Another day for another meeting
------------------------------------------
Hank again bikes to work ... but its a lumpier ride ... has global warming taken
its toll on the roads.  Repeat mini-game.
Cris struggles AGAIN to walk to work.  Her cancer is getting worse
Make mini-game harder
Hank meets up with Cris.  They smile at each other after admiration for each other's
devotion and effort in try to save the human race.  We find out that Cris's mom
also had cancer.  A departing gift was her pair of earrings (important later on)

Chapter5 - Experiments in the lab
---------------------------------
Mini-game: Hank plays around of a simulation of a machine that can potentially
travel faster than the speed of light
Mini-game: Cris: she experiments with DNA (4 letters words with DNA)
At the end ... both of their experiments fail.  Cris helps fix Hank's program
(with a ===), but even then, Hank's plan for space travel looks dismal.  Cris' project
seems to have problems too.  Her wonder-drug may be carcinogenic
Both share a despairing moment ... but amongst this darkness, they find ... each
other.  Their pain of knowing that this world is doomed is comforted by the union of
their eyes as they kiss for the first time

Chapter6 - The phone call
-------------------------
The next morning, Hank gets a phone call.  Its from the Hospital.  They tell
him that Cris has feinted.  Hank rushes to the hospital
TODO: think of mini-game

Chapter7 - The rose
-------------------


Chapter8 - The Earring
-------------------
Hank has figured out a way to save the human race, inspired by Cris.
The pair of Earring inspire him ... spooky science:  Quantum Entanglement.
Via quantum entanglement, he established communcation with a species in another
galaxy.  The alien tell Hank about their ways of curing cancer.
The Alien says that he can't save Earth, but he can save both Hank and Cris.
With a combination of the earring and the alien's
technology, the earring acts as a cataylst to open a dimension to the other world
due to its idential quantum spin / signature ... spooky science - something
faster than the speed of light.

Hank asks Cris:  Do you trust me?
Cris ... yes (slowly) ... then YES (with more determination - out of love)
Hank carries Cris to the other side ... and the new story of another Adam
and Eve begins.

THE END
